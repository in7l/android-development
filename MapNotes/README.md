# MapNotes

This is a custom application created as the final project in an Android development course.

The topic was free to choose and course participants had to design and implement an application on their own.

## Google Play

This application was once published to Google Play but, as it has not been updated to work with newer Android versions, it got auto-unpublished at one point.

## Functionality

* The user sees a map and they can add notes (some text) to any point in the map.
* The user can adjust the radius (in meters or kilometers) from their current position (determined with GPS), and they get a list of all notes that fall within that radius.
* The idea was that this is a fun way to try out multiple different things: UI elements, storing data to a database, and location services.
* In principle my idea was that I could add a shopping list for different shops and when I go to those shops it would show me the relevant shopping list based on my location.
